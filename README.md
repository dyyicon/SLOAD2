# SLOAD2
SLOAD2 is constructed to provide high-quality synthetic lethal gene pairs.The multi-omics data of 33 cancers from TCGA were integrated to explore the single-molecule data characteristics of synthetic lethal genes from DNA mutation, methylation, copy number variation, mRNA expression and ncRNA related data. In addition, cross-talk at different molecular levels was integrated and analyzed from the perspective of regulatory network around isomiR to find potential data association characteristics. Training sets were constructed for each cancer type to address the specificity of synthetic lethal effects. Random forest and other methods were used to analyze and predict the optimal algorithm, which could be used to predict and screen the candidate gene combinations with synthetic lethal effect in specific cancers.
